## Quick start

1. See [build-prerequisites](#build-prerequisites) and install the required software.
2. Clone [`neovim/neovim`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).
3. Build Neovim by running `make`. Note that on BSD systems `gmake` ("GNU Make") should be run instead.

`make` pulls down third-party dependencies (such as libuv and LuaJIT) into `.deps/`, and builds them.
If you encounter issues while attempting to build Neovim, see [Troubleshooting#build-issues](Troubleshooting#build-issues).

To generate the `Makefile`s without building: `make cmake`

If you plan on building Neovim frequently, it's recommended you install [`ninja`](https://martine.github.io/ninja/), a build system much faster than traditional `make`. It's not required, but will be used by the top-level Makefile if available.

Now that you have the dependencies, you can try other build targets and options, explained below.

## Running tests

### Integration tests

To build and run all integration tests:

    $ make test

### Unit tests

To build and run all unit tests:

    $ make unittest

To run a *specific* unit test:

    $ TEST_FILE=test/unit/foo.lua make unittest

### Legacy integration tests

To build and run all legacy (Vim) integration tests:

    $ make oldtest

### Functional tests

`$GDB` can be set to [run tests under gdbserver](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1527). If `$VALGRIND` is also set, it will add the `--vgdb=yes` option to valgrind instead of
starting gdbserver directly.

## Optimized builds

    $ rm -r build && make clean && make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

For developers and "edge" users, `RelWithDebInfo` is recommended over `Release` as the latter doesn't generate debug info.

To verify that the build was optimized, you can set `VERBOSE=1` and look for the `-O` flag:

```
$ rm -r build && make VERBOSE=1 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel | grep -E '\-O(2|s|g)'
$ cc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DINCLUDE_GENERATED_DECLARATIONS -Os ... -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Wno-unused-parameter -Wstrict-prototypes -std=gnu99 ...
```

An alternative to `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`:

    $ rm -r build && make cmake CFLAGS='-Wno-error -O2 -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1' && make

- `-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1` is required because of [#223](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/223).
- To see the full build output (including flags send to the compiler by make/CMake), change the `make` step to `VERBOSE=1 make`

## Localization build

A normal build will create all the `.mo` files in `build/src/nvim/po`.

* If you see `msgfmt: command not found`, you need to install [`gettext`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext). On most systems the package is just called `gettext`.

## Localization check

- Change into the build directory and run `make check-po-$LANG` where `$LANG`
  is the language you want to check.  For instance, `make check-po-de` or `make
  check-po-pt_BR`.
- `check-po-$LANG` generates a detailed report in
  `./build/src/nvim/po/check-${LANG}.log`. Note: this report is generated by Vim to help identify errors in the translations, not by `msgfmt`.

## Localization update

To update the `src/nvim/po/$LANG.po` file with the latest strings from sources, run
`make update-po-$LANG`.

## "GNU-like" (GCC, Clang, etc.) compiler options

To see the chain of includes, use the `-H` option ([#918](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/918)):

```
$ echo '#include "./src/nvim/buffer.h"' | \
> clang -I.deps/usr/include -Isrc -std=c99 -P -E -H - 2>&1 1>/dev/null | \
> grep -v '/usr/'
```

- `grep -v /usr/` is used to filter out system header files
- `-save-temps` can be added as well to see expanded macros or commented assembly

## Xcode and MSVC project files

CMake has a `-G` option for exporting to multiple [project file formats](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#section_Generators), such as Xcode and Visual Studio. 

For example, to use Xcode's static analysis GUI ([#167](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/167#issuecomment-36136018)), you need to generate an Xcode project file from the Neovim makefile (where `neovim/` is the top-level Neovim source code directory containing the main `Makefile`):

    $ cmake -G Xcode neovim

then open the resulting project file in Xcode.

## Custom Makefile

You can customize the build process locally by creating a `local.mk`, which is referenced at the top of the main `Makefile`. It's listed in `.gitignore` so it can be used across branches. **A new target in `local.mk` overrides the default make-target.**

Here's a sample `local.mk` which adds a target to force a rebuild but *does not* override the default-target:

```make
all:

rebuild:
	rm -rf build && make
```

## Controlling the build for third-party dependencies ([#1588](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1588))

To build the bundled dependencies using CMake:

```
$ mkdir .deps
$ cd .deps
$ cmake ../third-party
$ make
```

By default, the libraries and headers are placed in `.deps/usr`, afterwards you can build Neovim using:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

You can build the dependencies in a different location using:

```
$ mkdir deps2
$ cd deps2
$ cmake ../third-party/
$ make
$ cd ..
```

And then build Neovim using:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DDEPS_PREFIX=../deps2/usr ..
```

When changing `DEPS_PREFIX`, you may need to clear the CMake cache in order for the changes to take effect.

## General notes on [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/examples/)

- `cmake -LAH` prints all variable definitions.
- `build/CMakeCache.txt` contains the resolved values of all variables used by CMake.
- `build/compile_commands.json` shows the full compiler invocations for each translation unit.

## Build Prerequisites

General requirements:
- A recent version of Clang or GCC (at least `4.3`, see [#1469](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1469#issuecomment-63058312))
- CMake (at least `2.8.7`) built with TLS/SSL support ([#1469](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1469#issuecomment-63058312))

Platform-specific dependencies are listed below.

### Ubuntu / Debian

    $ sudo apt-get install libtool libtool-bin autoconf automake cmake g++ pkg-config unzip

### CentOS/RHEL/Fedora

If you're using CentOS/RHEL 6 you need at least autoconf version 2.69 for
compiling the libuv dependency. See https://github.com/joyent/libuv/issues/1158.

    $ sudo yum -y install autoconf automake cmake gcc gcc-c++ libtool make pkgconfig unzip

### openSUSE

    $ sudo zypper install libtool autoconf automake cmake gcc-c++

### Arch Linux

    $ sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake unzip

### FreeBSD 10

    $ sudo pkg install cmake gmake libtool sha automake pkgconf unzip wget

Note: if you have CMake installed already, you may need to re-install it.  The
port had to be updated to support TLS/SSL for file downloads, so your installed version may not have
that feature.

If you get an error regarding a sha256sum mismatch, where
the actual sha256sum is `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`, then this is your issue (that's the sha256sum of an empty file). Also, make sure you have wget installed.
LuaRocks has bad interactions with cURL, at least under FreeBSD, and will die with
a PANIC in LuaJIT when trying to install a rock.

### OpenBSD -current

```
# pkg_add gmake cmake libtool unzip autoconf-2.69p1 automake-1.15
$ export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69
$ export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15
```

Additionally, jemalloc 3.6.0 doesn't build on OpenBSD, so it must be disabled.

```
$ cat > local.mk << EOF
> DEPS_CMAKE_FLAGS := -DUSE_BUNDLED_JEMALLOC=OFF
> EOF
```

### OS X

* Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/) and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
  or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org)
* Install Xcode commandline tools `xcode-select --install`
* Install other dependencies:

  Via MacPorts:

      $ sudo port install libtool autoconf automake cmake pkgconfig gettext
      
  Via Homebrew:

      $ brew install libtool automake cmake pkg-config gettext

* After this you may need to run `make distclean && make` before the tests will run.

* **If you see wget certificate errors** (for OS X *before* version 10.10/Yosemite):

  Via MacPorts:

      $ sudo port install curl-ca-bundle
      $ echo CA_CERTIFICATE=/opt/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt >> ~/.wgetrc

  Via Homebrew:

      $ brew install curl-ca-bundle
      $ echo CA_CERTIFICATE=$(brew --prefix curl-ca-bundle)/share/ca-bundle.crt >> ~/.wgetrc

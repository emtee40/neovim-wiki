# Introduction
Below is a list of project ideas for [GSoC 2017](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/). These projects may require familiarity with c, makefiles, python, lua or vimscript.

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is an extension of Vim. The [vision](https://neovim.io/charter/) of Neovim goes into the Projects goals and non-goals. One of the goals is to build a project the encourages "hacking" and collaboration. Effort is put into removing barriers for contributors and improving documentation. The wiki has sections on developing and contributing to help you get started working with Neovim.

The Neovim source has roots in 1987 which means many libraries such as [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) were not around at that time. The code base can be made easier to maintain and understand by using these libraries. Project ideas that involve working heavily with internals will in the general case be more difficult than project ideas that "simply" add new features. However working with older/complex parts of the code base can also provide valuable learning feedback for writing simpler and more maintainable code. There is a large range of skills that can be learned and working with the team to find a project that will help you the most is in your benefit.

We encourage you to join the #neovim IRC or [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/neovim/neovim) to discuss these projects with the community and our mentors. Because communication is a big part of open source development you are expected to get in touch with us before making your application

The following list of projects are just some ideas. We are happy to hear any suggestions that you may have.

## Tips 

- Anywhere a Vim concept (such as "textlock") is mentioned, you can find what it means by using the ":help" command (`:help textlock`).
- Ask questions and post your partial work frequently (say, once every day or 2, if possible). It's OK if work is messy; just put "[WIP]" in the pull request (PR) title.
- Take advantage of the continuous integration (CI) systems which automatically run against your pull
requests. When you send work to a PR,  the full test-suite runs on the PR while you continue to work locally.

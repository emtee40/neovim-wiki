Neovim was forked from Vim 7.4.160; it is kept up-to-date with relevant Vim patches in order to avoid duplicate work. For details, see [issue #438](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/438).

Visit the [**vim patch report**](http://neovim.org/doc/reports/vimpatch/) to see which patches are needed.

Everyone is welcome to send pull requests for relevant Vim patches (see [below](#pull-requests)). But some types of patches are **not relevant to Neovim:**

- **Compiler warning fixes**: Neovim strives to have no warnings at all, and has a very different build system from Vim.
- **#ifdef tweaking**: For example, Vim decided to enable `FEAT_VISUAL` for all platformsâ€”but Neovim already does that. Adding new `FEAT_` guards also isn't relevant to Neovim.
- **Legacy system support**: Fixes for legacy systems such as Solaris, Amiga, Xenix, Mac OS 9, Windows 95, MS-DOS, are not needed because they are not supported by Neovim.
- Most **GUI-related** changes: Neovim GUIs are implemented external to the core C codebase.

Anything else might be relevant; err on the side of caution, and post an issue if you aren't sure. 

To mark a patch as "Not Applicable", append `NA` next to the commented-out patch number in `version.c`.

Quick start
-----------

Say you've pulled down the Neovim source, and you want to merge Vim patch 7.4.123. Then just run [`vim-patch.sh`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/scripts/vim-patch.sh):

    ./scripts/vim-patch.sh 7.4.123

The script guides you with further instructions. It's easy and it won't hose your workspace, so just try it!

Pull requests
-------------

Please include `vim-patch:7.4.xxx` in the *pull request* title. In addition, the [*commit message*](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/4ccf1125ff569eccfc34abc4ad794044c5ab7455) should include:

- A token indicating the Vim patch number, formatted as follows (no space!): <br/>
  `vim-patch:7.4.123`
- A URL pointing to the Vim commit:
    - https://code.google.com/p/vim/source/detail?r=5d03c374712128077ac4c342aad02120ed98df70
- The original Vim commit message, including the author

Parts of the workflow have been automated (see [#1513](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1513)).


Code differences
----------------

- Where Vim code uses `malloc()` and friends, merges to Neovim [should use `xmalloc` and related `memory.c` "x-functions"](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/691#issuecomment-52400360).
- Where Vim code uses `vim_free()`, Neovim uses `free()`.
- Vim tests (in `src/testdir/`) should be converted to lua tests (see [#1286](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1286) and [#1328](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1328))
- `copy_chars()` and `copy_spaces()` were removed; use `memset()` instead [#1635](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1635)

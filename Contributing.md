## Thank you

Thanks for considering contributing to neovim. To make the process as smooth as possible we would ask you to follow the guidelines below.

## Help with contributing

See [Communicating](Communicating). Raise documentation issues.

## Guidelines

### Reporting an issue

- Search existing issues before raising a new one.

- Include as much detail as possible. In particular, we need to know which OS you're using.

### Pull requests

- Use a feature branch, not master.

- Rebase your feature branch onto origin/master before raising the PR.

- Keep up to date with changes in master so your PR is easy to merge.

- Be descriptive in your PR message: what is it for, why is it needed, etc.

- Make sure the tests pass (TODO: we need to make this easier with travis etc.)

- Squash related commits as much as possible.

### Coding style

- Try to match the existing indent style. (TODO: specify)

- Don't abuse the pre-processor.

- Don't mix platform-specific stuff into the main code.

- TODO: commit messages?

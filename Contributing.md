### Pull Requests

When submitting pull requests, tag it to help others knowing the status of the pull.
This avoids merging requests that are not yet ready or reviewed.
By tagging, you'll also save reviewers and mergers some work.

The following tags should be used in the subject as `[TAG] My contribution`.

* `WIP` - Work In Progress. The pull request will change, and there is no need to review it yet.
* `RFC` - Request For Comment. The request needs reviewing and/or comments.
* `RDY` - The request is ready to be merged. The request must have been reviewed by at least one person and have no outstanding issues.


If the pull request has a tag, only `RFC` and `RDY` might be merged.

If a pull request doesn't have a tag, it's considered `WIP` as long as there are no comments indicating it's `RFC` or `RDY`.

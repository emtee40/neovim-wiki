_See **[Quickstart](#quickstart)** to get started immediately. Also note the section on [**Not Applicable**](#na-not-applicable-patches) patches._

Neovim was forked from Vim 7.4.160; it is kept up-to-date with relevant Vim patches in order to avoid duplicate work. To see the status of Vim patches, go to the  [**vim patch report**](http://neovim.io/doc/reports/vimpatch/) or run [`vim-patch.sh`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/scripts/vim-patch.sh): 

    ./scripts/vim-patch.sh -l

Everyone is welcome to [send pull requests](#pull-requests) for relevant Vim patches, but some types of patches are [not applicable](#na-not-applicable-patches).

Quickstart
----------

1. Pull down the Neovim source:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git
   ```
2. Run `./scripts/vim-patch.sh -l` to see the list of missing Vim patches.
3. Choose a patch from the list (usually the _oldest_ one), e.g. `8.0.0123`.
4. Run `./scripts/vim-patch.sh -p 8.0.0123`
5. Follow the instructions given by the script.

It's strongly recommended to work on the _oldest_ patch from the list (just make sure someone didn't already start working on it), because some patches might depend on others. You're most likely going to encounter merge conflicts regardless, but this way such conflicts are kept to a minimum.


Pull requests
-------------

_Note:_ **[vim-patch.sh](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/scripts/vim-patch.sh)** automates these steps for you. Use it!

- The pull request *title* should include `vim-patch:8.0.xxxx` (no whitespace) 
- The [*commit message*](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/4ccf1125ff569eccfc34abc4ad794044c5ab7455) should include:
    - A token indicating the Vim patch number, formatted as follows: <br/>
     `vim-patch:8.0.0123` (no whitespace)
    - A URL pointing to the Vim commit:
        - https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/c8020ee825b9d9196b1329c0e097424576fc9b3a
    - The original Vim commit message, including author

**Reviewers:** [hint for reviewing `runtime/` patches](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1744#issuecomment-68202876)

N/A ("Not Applicable") patches
------------------------------

Many Vim patches are not applicable to Neovim. If you find NA patches, find the existing `version.c: update` pull request by @marvim and mention the NA patches in a comment. Example: [PR #7886](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7886)

If you are working on a series of patches, you may notice some "Not Applicable" patches. In that case you may want to mark the NA patches a commit message. To do so, use this format _exactly_ (each patch on a separate line):

    vim-patch:<version-or-commit>
    vim-patch:<version-or-commit>
    ...

where `<version-or-commit>` is valid a Vim version tag like `8.0.0123` or a valid commit-id (hash) from the Vim git repo.

### Types of "Not Applicable" Vim patches:

- **Compiler warning fixes**: Neovim strives to have no warnings at all, and has a very different build system from Vim.
    - **Note:** Coverity fixes in Vim *are* relevant to Neovim.
- **#ifdef tweaking**: For example, Vim decided to enable `FEAT_VISUAL` for all platforms â€” but Neovim already does that. Adding new `FEAT_` guards also isn't relevant to Neovim.
- **Legacy system support**: Fixes for legacy systems such as Amiga, OS/2 Xenix, Mac OS 9, Windows older than XP SP2, are not needed because they are not supported by Neovim.
- **`if_*.c`** changes: `if_python.c` et. al. were removed.
- **term.c** changes: the Neovim TUI uses libtermkey to read terminal sequences; Vim's `term.c` was removed.
- Most **GUI-related** changes: Neovim GUIs are implemented external to the core C codebase.
- Anything else might be relevant; err on the side of caution, and post an issue if you aren't sure. 

version.c
---------

The list of Vim patches in `src/nvim/version.c` is [automatically updated](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7780) based on the presence of `vim-patch:xxx` tokens in the Neovim git log.

- Don't update `src/nvim/version.c` yourself.
  - `scripts/vim-patch.sh -p` intentionally omits `version.c` to avoid merge conflicts and save time when porting a patch.
- The automation script (`scripts/vimpatch.lua`) only recognizes tokens like `vim-patch:8.0.1206`, not `vim-patch:<hash>`.

- Vim's `ga_init2` was renamed to `ga_init` and the original `ga_init` is gone.
- "Old style" Vim tests (`src/testdir/*.in`) should be converted to Lua tests (see [#1286](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1286) and [#1328](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1328)). See [Checklist for migrating legacy tests][checklist]. 
    - However, please _do not_ convert "new style" Vim tests (`src/testdir/*.vim`) to Lua. The "new style" Vim tests are faster than the old ones, and converting them takes time and effort better spent elsewhere. Just copy them to `src/nvim/testdir/*.vim` and update `src/nvim/testdir/Makefile`.
- Conditions that check `enc_utf8` or `has_mbyte` are obsolete (only the "true" case is applicable).
- List management has changed in Neovim, see this [wiki page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/List-management-in-Neovim).

Documentation differences
-------------------------

The following should be removed from all imported documentation, and not be used in new documentation:

- `{not in Vi}` : we don't care about compatibility with Vi (see [`818f7ae`][vi-annotations]).
- `{Only when compiled with ...}` - the vast majority of features have been made non-optional (see [Introduction](Introduction#legacy-support-and-compile-time-features))

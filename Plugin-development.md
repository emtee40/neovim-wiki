This page contains advice to guide (lua) plugin authors.

One goal is to converge towards a standard in plugins so that some automation can be reached, e.g., in option discovery, setup or even plugin installation (see https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14375 for a WIP).


# Lua dependency management

To avoid every user having to specify manually each plugin dependencies as it is common nowadays, it is possible to leverage luarocks. See [this blogpost](https://teto.github.io/posts/2021-09-17-neovim-plugin-luarocks.html) for more context.

As a plugin author, you can
1. Copy for instance this rockspec https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim/blob/master/plenary.nvim-scm-1.rockspec in your repo , update the different fields to match your project and carefully rename the file (luarocks fails if the file prefix doesnâ€™t match the project name)
2. (optional) If your plugin can be leveraged/referenced by other plugins as is the case for plenary.nvim, you should register your plugin on www.luarocks.org (either via the website or via `luarocks upload`).
3. (optional) Configure a CI to check your rockspeck works at all times. (TODO)

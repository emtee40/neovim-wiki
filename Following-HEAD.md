This document is meant for people who wish to run a development build of Neovim, i.e., the most recent commit.
It's purpose is only to document breaking changes, so should NOT be used as a reference for new features; that's what [`:help nvim-intro`](http://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim_intro.html) is for.

If you haven't already, see either [Building-Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim)
or [Installing-Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim), depending on your preferred installation method.
